Hello
In this project I am learning how to work with different tools to put to use
what I have learned in the past few months. It is a challenge, but every day
it seems to get a little easier. Google and the w3 have been lifesavers every
step of the way. Codepen was very helpful until you try and get your stuff
over to hear. The visual basic is a work in progress. I might try a few videos
to see if I can master it.
